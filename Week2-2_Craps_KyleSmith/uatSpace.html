For our craps game on the html side, we need:
    1. Button to play craps
    2. Craps status line (won or lost)
    3. Header saying craps played here

The story of our craps game...
After colonizing Mars humans made the first discovery of an alien spieces.
After first contact humans attempted to connect through various games involving numbers,
thinking that the aliens may better understand numbers rather then speech. To the explorers
surprise the martian species particularly enjoyed craps for its simplistisity and randomness.
Thus, UAT familiarizes every new cadet with the game of craps,so that in the event a UAT cadet
should meet our new friends on mars they can enjoy a familar game as a friendly
introduction ritual.
